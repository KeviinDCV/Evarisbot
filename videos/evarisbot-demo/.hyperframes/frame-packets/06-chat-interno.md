## Selected blueprint: transcript-scroll-artifact-reveal

# transcript-scroll-artifact-reveal — Transcript-Scroll Artifact Reveal

**intent**: The frame travels vertically along ONE long content surface — an agent transcript, a running task feed, an analysis document, a story draft — rendered full-bleed on a flat canvas (no device frame, no held mockup), by camera pan or element scroll; the traversal itself is the story ("look how much work happened / how much is here"), until ONE focal interaction — a file-chip click, a quote highlight, a collapsible-row expand — pivots the shot into an artifact/detail reveal: the deliverable behind the work.

**roles served**

- Key_Feature (modes: `pan-to-workspace` · `feed-rush` · `document-to-artifact` · `selection-pivot`): the x-viral AI-product grammar for "the agent did a lot of work → here's the deliverable." The long surface is the EVIDENCE (tool pills, checked progress items, task rows, headings, comps tables, story paragraphs), read at traversal pace; the artifact is the PAYOFF (full workspace with live mockup, spreadsheet with highlighted cells, inline ask-panel, sub-task stack). Reach for it when the feature's proof is the volume/depth of generated work and the beat should cash that in on one interaction — not a held device tour (`device-surface-showcase`), not a cursor-chased workflow (`cursor-ui-demo`).

**duration**: 5–11.8s (feed-rush 5.4s · pan-to-workspace 5.0s · selection-pivot 9.3s · document-to-artifact 11.75s)

**shot structure** One `[long content surface: agent chat transcript / task feed / analysis document / story doc]` sits full-bleed on a `[flat light canvas]` (goldens: warm off-white / cream / beige / plain white — the surface's own background IS the scene background); dark text with small `[accent]` marks (green verb highlights, model-tag pills, check circles, yellow cells). Three acts: TRAVERSE → HINGE → ARTIFACT. Camera discipline is the signature: at most TWO real camera moves in the whole shot, bracketing the hinge; everything else is element motion on a static frame.

- **Scene 1 (0.0–~40–60% of runtime) — establish + vertical traversal (the evidence).** The surface establishes with one small opener — a `[title]` types on / a centered `[title]` shrinks ~50% and glides to the top-left to dock as a fixed header / the frame opens tight on the `[chat panel]` — then the traversal begins: the frame travels DOWN the content (or the content streams UP through the frame), revealing progressive work in reading order: `[prompt → tool pills → checked progress items → typed summary]`, `[tagged task rows → muted tasks → checklist block]`, `[heading → paragraph → comps table → bullets]`, `[title → story paragraphs → dialogue]`. New rows may cascade in (staggered arrival) before the scroll takes over; a typed line may finish under the moving frame. Traversal texture varies by member: one continuous slow pan, a fast continuous feed rush, stepped scrolls decelerating at each stop (speed-blur between stops, content fading at frame edges), or one smooth scroll easing to a stop.
- **Scene 2 (~1–2s) — the hinge: ONE focal interaction.** The traversal settles and a single interaction pivots the shot: a `[file-attachment chip]` spring-pops in below a typed handoff line and a cursor glides in and CLICKS it; a `[sentence/quote]` gets a selection-highlight sweep and a `[tooltip pill]` spring-pops above it for the click; a `[collapsible row]` reaches the frame center and EXPANDS; or the typed `[verifier summary]` completes as the implicit trigger. This is the only interaction in the shot — the cursor (if any) appears here for the first time.
- **Scene 3 (rest) — artifact reveal + hold.** The hinge cashes in, choosing ONE reveal mechanic: a fast smoothly-DECELERATING zoom-OUT re-frames the whole `[workspace]` (the panel just traversed becomes a sidebar beside a `[live mockup]` and `[tool panel]`); an `[artifact window: spreadsheet]` scales up from small toward full frame, then a slow push-in + lateral pan settles on its `[highlighted cells]`; an `[inline panel]` expands below the highlighted line and a `[follow-up question]` types into it; or the row unfolds into a `[sub-task stack]` and the scroll settles on `[narration text]`. Optional coda: one cursor click instantly swaps a `[screen]` inside the revealed artifact (e.g. a phone tab click). Frame locks; element motion only to the end.

- Variant — _pan-to-workspace_ (001_claudeai, 5.0s): traversal is a REAL camera pan — opens tight on the chat panel, one single uninterrupted downward glide (never cutting away) over pills → checked list → typing verifier summary; hinge is the summary completing; reveal is ONE rapid decelerating zoom-out to the three-part workspace (chat-as-sidebar / phone mockup / tweaks panel); coda cursor click swaps the phone screen instantly. Exactly two camera moves total.
- Variant — _feed-rush_ (010_perplexity A, 5.4s): NO camera at all — title docks to header, five tagged rows cascade in, then a fast continuous upward ELEMENT scroll races through muted tasks and a checklist to a collapsible row; hinge is the row itself; reveal is the row expanding into a six-item sub-task stack, settling on narration. Cursorless.
- Variant — _document-to-artifact_ (010_perplexity B, 11.75s): traversal is a stepped ELEMENT scroll (static frame) — the document climbs in fast steps, decelerating at each stop, blur/fade between stops, clearing to blank canvas; hinge is a typed handoff line + file-chip pop + cursor click; reveal is the spreadsheet window scaling up then one slow continuous push-in + rightward pan onto the yellow-highlighted forecast columns.
- Variant — _selection-pivot_ (014_OpenAI, 9.3s): typed headline → document builds (bubble prompt + typed title + populating paragraphs) → one smooth upward element scroll eases to a stop; hinge is the selection-highlight sweep + the shot's ONE push-in framing the sentence + tooltip-pill click; reveal is the inline panel expanding below the line with the referenced quote and a rapidly-typed follow-up question. Camera locked at the pushed-in zoom to the end.

**motion vocabulary** continuous slow downward camera pan; fast continuous upward feed scroll; stepped document scroll decelerating at each stop; smooth scroll easing to a stop; speed-blur between scroll stops; content fade at frame edges; centered title shrinks ~50% and glides to a top-left header dock; task rows cascade in staggered; typed line / typed title / typed follow-up question (caret); green leading-verb highlights and model-tag pills riding past; checked-item strikethroughs riding past; file-attachment chip spring pop-in; tooltip pill spring pop; chat-bubble arrival; cursor glide-in + click; selection-highlight sweep across a sentence; ONE camera push-in onto the selection; fast decelerating zoom-out to the full workspace; artifact window scales up from small; slow push-in + lateral pan settling on highlighted cells; collapsible row expands into a sub-task stack; inline panel expands below the line; phone-screen instant swap on a coda tab click; frame-lock hold.

**rule mapping**

- vertical traversal by ELEMENT scroll — fast feed rush / stepped document scroll / smooth scroll-to-stop → `3d-page-scroll` (flat variant: tilt ≈ 0 — the surface's content `translateY`-scrolls to sections; the multi-phase scroll variant covers stepped stops; keep ONE ease family across all steps — `power3.out`/`power4.out` for UI-scroll feel)
- vertical traversal by CAMERA pan (transcript glide) → `viewport-change` (pan mode — the world translates up under a static frame; one continuous tween, no cuts)
- speed-blur between stepped-scroll stops → `motion-blur-streak` (blur peaks at max scroll velocity, resolves to 0 at each settle)
- which content each traversal beat reveals (stop-by-stop sequencing) → `dynamic-content-sequencing`
- centered title shrinks and glides to dock as a fixed header → `gsap-effects` (one simultaneous scale + translate tween; plain two-property move, no named rule required)
- task rows cascade in staggered before the scroll takes over → `waterfall-entry` (arrival cascade; goldens use fade + slide-up — the house rule prescribes binary-opacity whip-in, adopt the house form) or `spring-pop-entrance` (staggered group) for card-like rows
- typed lines — verifier summary, handoff line, document title, follow-up question, opening headline → `discrete-text-sequence` (+ `context-sensitive-cursor` for the trailing caret)
- file-attachment chip pop-in / tooltip pill pop / chat-bubble arrival → `spring-pop-entrance`
- cursor glides in, lands, clicks (hinge and coda) → `cursor-click-ripple` (+ `physics-press-reaction` to compress cursor and target together on the press)
- selection-highlight sweep across the sentence → `css-marker-patterns` (highlight sweep)
- ONE push-in onto the highlighted selection / slow push-in + lateral pan settling on highlighted cells → `coordinate-target-zoom` (measured off-center target — the lateral pan IS the counter-translate component), sequenced under `multi-phase-camera` when it follows the window scale-up
- fast decelerating zoom-OUT to the full workspace → `coordinate-target-zoom` (zoom-out variation: open at the zoomed-in framing, pull to scale 1 with `power3.out`/`power4.out`) or `viewport-change` (single continuous pull on the `cam` object)
- artifact window scales up from small toward full frame on the click → `spring-pop-entrance` (hero arrival scale-up; tune overshoot to ~0 / `power3.out` so the window reads weighty, not bouncy)
- collapsible row expands into a sub-task stack / inline panel expands below the highlighted line → `anchored-layout-expand` (in-flow accordion growth pushing subsequent content DOWN — never tween width/height) + `waterfall-entry` (or `spring-pop-entrance` stagger) on the arriving children
- phone-screen instant swap on the coda tab click → `discrete-text-sequence` (discrete whole-state swap; instant, no in-artifact camera move)
- green verb highlights, model-tag pills, check-circle strikethroughs, yellow forecast cells, edge fade masks → static styling of the surface content — no motion rule needed

**camera modifier**: The blueprint's camera law: **at most TWO real camera moves, bracketing the hinge** — the goldens are emphatic (their briefs carry CRITICAL camera notes). Pick the traversal mechanic first: camera pan (`viewport-change` pan — pan-to-workspace only) OR element scroll (`3d-page-scroll` flat — all others); never both at once. The reveal then spends the second (or only) move: one zoom-OUT to the workspace or one push-IN to the detail (`coordinate-target-zoom`, phases sequenced by `multi-phase-camera`), after which the frame LOCKS — all remaining motion is element-level (typing, expand, screen swap). The feed-rush variant spends zero camera moves: the whole shot is element scroll + expand. This restraint is what separates the shape from `cursor-ui-demo` (camera servos to every interaction) and from `device-surface-showcase` (a showcase camera presenting a held hero).

**Overflow (scrolled/panned surfaces — required for a clean `check`):** the traversal deliberately moves content past the frame edges. Clip at the scene (`overflow: hidden`) AND mark the moving inner layer (the `.page-content` / `.world` wrapper carrying the transcript/feed/document) with `data-layout-allow-overflow` — otherwise `check` reports `text_box_overflow` / `container_overflow` for every row that has scrolled off. The clip handles it visually; the attribute tells the layout audit it's intentional.

# Discrete Text Sequence

Instead of character-by-character typewriter, replace entire string states at time thresholds — enabling non-linear effects (typos, backspaces, bulk paste, "thinking" gaps) that smooth per-char typing can't achieve. If your effect is "type each character, no edits", this rule is overkill — use the smooth-slice variation below.

## How It Works

The typing is authored as a sparse array of `{ t, text }` states; on every `onUpdate` a **reverse search** finds the latest entry whose `t` has passed and renders its text. Display jumps between states with no animation between them — the realism comes from the schedule shape: fast keystroke clusters (0.06–0.20s apart), pauses at word breaks (0.3–0.6s), a typo, backspaces peeling back to the fork, then a bulk paste replacing many chars in one entry. A block cursor blinks via a deterministic sin square wave on the same timeline.

## Recipe

```html
<!-- inside a standard scene clip (hyperframes-core) -->
<div class="terminal">
  <div class="prompt">$</div>
  <div class="text-wrap">
    <span class="text" id="text"></span><span class="cursor" id="cursor">_</span>
  </div>
</div>
```

```css
.terminal {
  font-family: {monoFont}; /* monospace required — proportional jitters even in a fixed box */
  display: flex;
  align-items: baseline;
  font-size: TERMINAL_FONT_SIZE;
}
.text-wrap {
  display: inline-flex;
  align-items: baseline;
  min-width: TEXT_WRAP_MIN_WIDTH; /* ≥ widest state — stops right-edge jitter */
  white-space: nowrap;
}
.cursor {
  display: inline-block; /* inline ignores width */
  width: CURSOR_WIDTH;
}
```

```js
// Each entry shows from its t until the NEXT entry's t.
// Shape: keystrokes → typo → backspace to the fork → bulk paste → completion mark.
const SEQUENCE = [
  { t: 0.0, text: "" },
  { t: T_K1, text: "{p1}" }, // first keystrokes (~3-5 chars, 0.1-0.2s apart)
  { t: T_K2, text: "{p1 + ' ' + p2_typo}" }, // continuation containing a typo
  { t: T_BS, text: "{p1 + ' ' + p2_partial}" }, // backspace(s) — peel back to the fork
  { t: T_BULK, text: "{fullCorrectedText}" }, // bulk paste — many chars in one jump
  { t: T_DONE, text: "{fullCorrectedText + ' ✓'}" }, // completion marker
];

// Reverse-search for the latest entry whose t has passed
function textAt(time) {
  for (let i = SEQUENCE.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
    if (time >= SEQUENCE[i].t) return SEQUENCE[i].text;
  }
  return "";
}

const textEl = document.getElementById("text");
const cursorEl = document.getElementById("cursor");

const driver = { t: 0 };
tl.to(
  driver,
  {
    t: TOTAL_DURATION,
    duration: TOTAL_DURATION,
    ease: "none",
    onUpdate: () => {
      textEl.textContent = textAt(driver.t);
    },
  },
  0,
);

// Cursor blink — deterministic sin square wave, never a CSS animation
const blink = { p: 0 };
tl.to(
  blink,
  {
    p: Math.PI * 2 * BLINK_CYCLES,
    duration: TOTAL_DURATION,
    ease: "none",
    onUpdate: () => {
      cursorEl.style.opacity = Math.sin(blink.p) > 0 ? "1" : "0";
    },
  },
  0,
);
```

## Variations

- **Smooth character slice** (continuous typewriter — no pauses, no edits): faster to author but uniformly "machine-typed", missing the human realism:

```js
const fullText = "{fullPhrase}";
const len = { v: 0 };
tl.to(
  len,
  {
    v: fullText.length,
    duration: TYPE_DUR,
    ease: "power1.inOut",
    onUpdate: () => {
      textEl.textContent = fullText.substring(0, Math.floor(len.v));
    },
  },
  0,
);
```

- **Thinking pause** — hold one state for `THINK_HOLD_DUR` (0.8–2.0s; under 0.5s reads as a stutter, not thought) simply by leaving a gap before the next entry's `t`.
- **State pulse on completion** — when the final state lands, `tl.to(".text", { scale: 1.03–1.08, duration: 0.15–0.3, yoyo: true, repeat: 1 }, T_DONE)`.
- **Per-state color shift** — in `onUpdate`, branch on `driver.t` vs the milestones: success color after `T_DONE`, dim mid-edit, normal while typing.

| milestone `t`s      | keystrokes 0.06–0.20s apart; pauses 0.3–0.6s | monotonically increasing; `T_DONE ≤ TOTAL_DURATION − ~1s` climax dwell |
| TYPE_DUR (smooth)   | `chars × 0.06–0.12s`                         | fast → relaxed                                                         |
| BLINK_CYCLES        | one cycle per 0.5–0.8s                       | `TOTAL_DURATION / 0.8 ≤ BLINK_CYCLES ≤ TOTAL_DURATION / 0.5`           |
| CURSOR_WIDTH        | ~0.3× font size                              | gap to text single-digit px so the cursor feels attached               |

## Critical Constraints

- **Reverse-search the array each frame** — O(n) with small n (≤30 typical); don't index by frame, the sequence is sparse.
- **`min-width` on the text wrap is mandatory** — without it the right edge jitters as state length changes.
- **Discrete jumps must be INSTANT** — any transition on the text turns the jump into a smear and kills the "typing" feel.
- **Cursor blink is sin/sequence-driven on the timeline**, `display: inline-block`, monospace font, `white-space: nowrap` (wrapping mid-state breaks the illusion; trailing spaces must survive).
- **Discrete vs smooth** — use discrete only for non-linear states (typos, pauses, bulk paste); plain typing takes the smooth-slice variation.

# Spring-Pop Entrance

> **Smooth beats bouncy.** This entrance defaults to a smooth long-tail settle — `power3.out` (or `expo.out` for a faster front) — that decelerates cleanly into the resting size with **no overshoot**. Bouncy `back.out` is the **#1 instant turn-off** in agent-made videos and is almost never executed well; it is a rare, explicitly-playful exception (consumer / fun brand), never the default. When unsure, settle smoothly.

THE entrance primitive: an element (or staggered group) arrives by springing from nothing — `scale: 0 → 1`, optional small `y` rise — and settles without bouncing. This is **arrival**, not reaction: distinct from [press-release-spring.md](press-release-spring.md) (a click/press → release feedback chain on an element that already rests on screen). Many blueprints used to borrow that rule to fake an entrance; reach for this instead.

## How It Works

One `fromTo` carries the whole arrival: from `{ scale: 0, opacity: 0 }` (explicit, so t=0 is correct under seek) to `{ scale: 1, opacity: 1, ease: "power3.out" }`. For a **group**, the same `fromTo` runs per element at `i * STAGGER`, capped so the group reads as one arriving beat. The `scale` grow is load-bearing; the `y` rise is garnish — drop everything else and it must still read as a clean entrance. Let the ease produce the settle: never hand-key a `scale: 1.1` mid-state (it double-bounces against the curve).

## Recipe

```html
<!-- inside a standard scene clip (hyperframes-core) -->
<div class="pop-hero" id="hero">{heroLabel}</div>

<div class="pop-grid">
  <div class="pop-item">{itemA}</div>
  <div class="pop-item">{itemB}</div>
  <div class="pop-item">{itemC}</div>
</div>
```

```css
.pop-hero,
.pop-item {
  transform-origin: 50% 50%; /* in-place pop; move to the source point for the anchored variation */
  will-change: transform;
}
.pop-grid {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr);
  gap: GRID_GAP;
  place-items: center;
}
```

```js
// Single hero pop — smooth long-tail settle, no overshoot.
tl.fromTo(
  "#hero",
  { scale: 0, opacity: 0 },
  { scale: 1, opacity: 1, duration: POP_DUR, ease: "power3.out" },
  ENTRY_AT,
);

// Staggered group pop — one arriving beat.
gsap.utils.toArray(".pop-item").forEach((el, i) => {
  tl.fromTo(
    el,
    { scale: 0, opacity: 0, y: Y_RISE },
    { scale: 1, opacity: 1, y: 0, duration: POP_DUR, ease: "power3.out" },
    GROUP_ENTRY_AT + i * STAGGER,
  );
});
```

## Variations

- **Calm settle** (premium / enterprise): `power3.out`, no rotation, `Y_RISE` 0–12px — a weighted, confident landing for a hero wordmark or product shot.
- **Firm settle** (everyday default): `power3.out` or `expo.out` for a punchier front, `Y_RISE` ~24px — cards, icons, callouts.
- **Exact-physics settle**: when the settle IS the shot, swap the ease for `springEase({ response: 0.4 })` (critically damped) from `../adapters/gsap-easing-and-stagger.md` → Spring Eases; take `duration` from the helper.
- **Origin-anchored pop**: a callout growing out of a specific point (marker, pointer tip) sets `transform-origin` to that point (e.g. `0% 100%`) so `scale: 0 → 1` reads as "emerging from the source", not "inflating in place".
- **Pop into a held slot**: land the pop and hold still — no idle loop baked into the entrance. If the held frame genuinely needs life, hand off to [sine-wave-loop.md](sine-wave-loop.md) for subtle jitter on a separate later tween; prefer revealing the next element on its VO cue.
- **Bouncy pop (RARE — explicitly-playful only)**: swap the ease for `back.out(OVERSHOOT)` and optionally settle a small `rotation: ROT_FROM → 0` so elements look hand-placed. Only for a deliberately playful register — never product / enterprise / serious tone:

```js
tl.fromTo(
  el,
  { scale: 0, opacity: 0, rotation: ROT_FROM },
  { scale: 1, opacity: 1, rotation: 0, duration: POP_DUR, ease: `back.out(${OVERSHOOT})` },
  GROUP_ENTRY_AT + i * STAGGER,
);
```

Even here keep `OVERSHOOT ≤ ~2` — past that it reads as cartoon wobble. Better still: the baked spring at `dampingFraction: 0.6–0.7` (same adapters doc) gives ~5–10% overshoot that reads physical where `back.out` reads cartoon.

| ITEM_COUNT | 3–9                                       | >9 makes the stagger vanish — switch to a wipe/sweep reveal      |
| Y_RISE     | 0–32px                                    | small; never large enough to read as a slide-up                  |
| ROT_FROM   | −10°–+10°                                 | playful variant only; alternate sign by index (`i % 2 ? 6 : -6`) |
| ENTRY_AT   | 0–0.4s                                    | a beat of quiet, but keep the subject landing by t ≤ 0.5s        |

## Critical Constraints

- Default ease `power3.out` (no overshoot); `back.out` only in the explicitly-playful variant, and there `OVERSHOOT ≤ ~2`.
- `ITEM_COUNT × STAGGER ≤ ~0.5s` — the group must land inside one beat.
- Entrances state the collapsed from-state in `fromTo` — never rely on a CSS-hidden start (it renders visible before the tween claims it under seek).
- `transform-origin: 50% 50%` for an in-place pop; the source point only for the anchored variation.
- This is a finite arrival — idle motion on a held element is a separate, later `sine-wave-loop` tween.
